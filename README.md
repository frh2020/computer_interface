computer interface can be as simple as sending a signal to a port or/and then receive a signal from another. The rest of it is playing the dimensions of each process and parameters such as sending a series of timed signal and acquired an image with multiple pixels during a certain timeframe. On top of that, complex scheme can be built for desired operation.

you can use very simple basic language BASIC (as the name implies) or c for high speed response time, or assembly for very low level action, or graphic programming language like LabVIEW for instrument like operation.
