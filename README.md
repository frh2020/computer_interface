Computer- interfacing can be as simple as sending a signal to a port or/and receiving a signal from another. The rest of it is playing the dimensions of each process and parameters such as sending a timed signal sequence and acquired an image with multiple pixels during a specific timeframe. On top of these, you can design complex schemes for desired operations.

You can use very simple basic language BASIC (as the name implies) for a single task or C for high-speed response time, or Assembly for very low-level action, or graphic programming language like LabVIEW for an instrument-like operation.
